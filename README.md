# maven-notification-center

This is a tiny project intended to integrate *Maven* with *Notificaton Center* under *OS X 10.8: Mountain Lion* by generating build success and failure messages.

## terminal-notifier

This project builds on [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier), a tool for sending *notification center* notifications from the command-line and/or from Ruby. You can install it as a ruby gem, or as a Mac application bundle, and the means of invoking it changes somewhat based on how you've set it up. I've tried to make the script agnostic to this, but I'm using the gem-installed version, so if you're having trouble with this, get in touch with me.
