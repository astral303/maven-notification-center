# maven-notification-center

This is a tiny project intended to integrate *Maven* with *Notificaton Center* under *OS X 10.8: Mountain Lion* by generating build success and failure messages.

## terminal-notifier

This project builds on [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier), a tool for sending *notification center* notifications from the command-line and/or from Ruby. You can install it as a ruby gem, or as a Mac application bundle, and the means of invoking it changes somewhat based on how you've set it up. I'm using the gem-installed version, but if you've installed it as a Mac application, you'll need to modify the way the script invokes terminal-notifier slightly. If you're having trouble configuring that, get in touch.
